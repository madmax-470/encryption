These are my encryption codes that i tried to mimic in python.
i've developed a keen intrest in cryptography and am reading a book (THE CODE BOOK  by SIMON SINGH) which has some cryptographic algorithms made understood to a layman, So i tried to imitate those  and build them from scrath with python, So this repo contains all the cryptographic algorithms i've learned from  the book. I hope you learn something from this today! 

stay happy stay curious.....
